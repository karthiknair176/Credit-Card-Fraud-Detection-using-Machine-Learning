## Introduction
Credit card fraud has become one of the most pressing issues in today’s financial systems due to the rapid increase in online transactions. This project aims to analyze and predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. By examining transaction patterns and anomalies, the system classifies each transaction as either legitimate or fraudulent, thereby supporting proactive fraud prevention.

The primary beneficiaries of this project are banks, e-commerce platforms, and customers. For financial institutions, the system helps reduce revenue loss and enhance transaction security. For customers, it provides an added layer of trust and protection in digital payments.


## Unique Aspect of the Project

The distinctive feature of this project lies in its focus on imbalanced real-world financial data. While most academic projects use balanced datasets, this study simulates realistic fraud detection challenges through under sampling. Additionally, it compares two fundamentally different algorithms—KNN, a distance-based learner, and SVM, a margin-based classifier—to analyze which performs better under data imbalance conditions. This dual-model comparison strengthens the project’s analytical and practical relevance for financial fraud prevention. 


## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Both SVM and KNN achieved high accuracy; however, SVM provided superior performance in precision and recall, making it more suitable for real-world fraud detection.
